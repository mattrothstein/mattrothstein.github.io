### Stop using arrow keys in vim

When I first started using vim as my go to editor I relied heavily on the arrow keys. Once I realized how ineffcient it was I added this to my `.vimrc` so that I would start using `hjkl`.

```vim
  noremap <Up> <NOP>
  noremap <Down> <NOP>
  noremap <Left> <NOP>
  noremap <Right> <NOP>
```

Now when using the arrow keys in vim nothing happens. This forced me to use `hjkl` and I am much faster and more effecient.
